## What is Lightroom?
* Lightroom is an editing program that lets users name, edit or post-process, and add metadata to large collections of photographs. It's simple to use, but some instructions are needed to get started. In this tutorial we will look at the basics of how to use Lightroom. 
* The link to download Lightroom is located at [the Adobe website](https://helpx.adobe.com/download-install/kb/lightroom-downloads.html). You must sign in with an Adobe account to access Lightroom.

## Opening Lightroom

* When you first open the program, a pop-up box will appear asking you to name your catalog of images. For this tutorial, we'll use the name of the book and then an "_lrcat_" extention, which stands for Lightroom Catalog. 
* Once you name your LRcat, Lightroom will open. 
* Take note of the workspace options at the top of the screen:
  - **Library** is the default viewing window for your images.
  - **Develop** is the workspace where you can change the coloring, white balance, cropping space, and more.
  - **Map** lets you add a geographical location to your images by selecting them on a map.

## Setting Up to Capture or Upload Photos

* You have a couple of options: 
  - If you have already captured your images, you can import them quite easily from your computer using the **import** button in the lower left corner. Go ahead and import your files and then skip to the section on renaming photos if this applies to you.
  - If you haven't captured the images yet, you can set up a **tethered capture**, which will pull your images into the LRcat automatically as you capture them. This is very useful if you want to check the quality of your images as you go, allowing you to zoom in far more easily than on a small camera LCD screen. 

***Note*** You'll want to make sure that your camera is compatible with Lightroom. You can access a list of compatible cameras [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/tethered-camera-support.html) on Adobe's website.

* Attach your camera to your computer with a USB cable. Next, in Lightroom, go to **File**, **Tethered Capture**, and then **Start Tethered Capture**. 
* This pulls up a menu: 
  - The **Session Name** is the name of the folder where your images will be kept. 
  - The **Naming** section is where you set up your image file names. **Sequence** puts your images in sequential order, ie image_001, image_002, image_003,... If you want to change how this looks, click the dropdown menu, scroll to the bottom, and then select **edit**.
  - **Start Number** is usually kept at 1. If you need to delete and re-capture images you didn't like, you can change this start number to the one you need. 
  - You can add content to the **Metadata** section at the bottom if you want all of your images to contain the same information, such as your name or company name. This is something you can easily add to your images later on, so you can leave this blank.

## Renaming Photos

* You can easily change the name of an image, or a group of images. 
* Select at least one image. Make sure you are in the **Library** workspace, not **Develop**. On the right hand side of the screen, locate the File Name box.

![file name box]()

* You can change the individual image file name here, but if you want to rename a batch of images, click the little toggle button to the right of the file name to pull up a window. This lets you edit multiple image names at one.

***Note*** 
* File naming is important! If you change file names, do so carefully. If you make a mistake, some names will have a -2 at the end, such as image_023-2. This means that more than one image has the same file name. Track down the images and then change their names to fix this. Other errors include images appearing in the wrong order after you name them. Carefully pinpoint where the problem starts and edit the names until they are properly in order again. 

* If things go haywire, you change the sorting of your images from "**file name**" to "**capture time**" and vise versa. This is located **here**: 

![capturetime]()

* **Capture Time** puts your images back into the order that you originally captured them in. From here, you can track down where any naming errors began and fix them.

## Editing Photos

* Go to the **Develop** workspace. 
* From here you can crop your images, change the white balance, contrast, and brightness, among other options. Play around with these settings until you are happy with the look. If the images are too dark or too bright, change the ISO, Shutter Speed, and/or Aperture settings on your camera and capture these images again.
